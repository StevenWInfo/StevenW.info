#Code for StevenW.info

This is just the code for my website. I created it using [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/). It's pretty rough so don't use it as an example of a model hakyll site. There might be a few useful things though.

Oh, and please don't just copy this site wholesale. Create a site for yourself, not only because it's the right thing to do, but because it isn't that difficult to make something better than what's here. Using this as reference is alright though.
